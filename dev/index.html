		<p>As a Kurd, he left Iran to avoid religious persecution. Most Iranian Kurds, a minority in Iran, are Sunni Muslims and are being persecuted by the majority Shia Muslim population. Kurds have long fought for a federal state of their own, leading Ayatolla Khomeini to declare Jihad against the Kurdish people.</p>

		<h2 span class="place">3,740,000 persons of concern</span></h2>
		<p>The Sudanese government has been ethnically cleansing the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa peoples
			since 2003, when rebel groups from the marginalized minorities sought shared power with the
			Arab government. Government forces have directly overseen and participated in massacres, summary executions and other human rights abuses of civilian men, women and children in Darfur, one of the world’s
			poorest and most inaccessible regions.</p>

		<h2>Mymar</h2>
		<h2 span class="place">1,410,000 persons of concern</span></h2>
		<p>The Rohingya, an ethnic Muslim minority, is subject to discriminatory policies created by
			Myanmar’s Buddhist-dominated government. The Myanmar government refuses to grant citizenship to the Rohingya, who differs ethnically, linguistically and religiously from the Buddhist majority.
			 Without a government to fight for and protect the Rohingya’s basic human rights, the essentially
			stateless minority has no legal or enforceable rights and is therefore freely oppressed in Myanmar.</p>
